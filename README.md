# 💼 Portfolio | Santiago Delgado

This is my personal developer portfolio, built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in software development.

The foundation of this project is based on an open-source template created by [ibelick](https://github.com/ibelick/nim), which I have customized and adapted to better reflect my personal style and work.
